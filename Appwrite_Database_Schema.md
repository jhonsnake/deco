# Appwrite Database Schema - VozActiva Ciudadana

This document outlines the database schema for the VozActiva Ciudadana application using Appwrite as the backend.

## General Notes:

*   Appwrite automatically provides `$id` (unique ID), `$createdAt`, and `$updatedAt` for each document in a collection. These are not explicitly listed under attributes unless specific behavior or naming is intended.
*   Appwrite uses `Relationship` attributes for linking documents between collections.
*   Permissions are defined using Appwrite's role-based access control. Common roles include `any` (public), `users` (any authenticated user), `user:[USER_ID]` (specific user), and `team:[TEAM_ID]` (specific team, e.g., admins).

## 1. Collection: `users`

*   **Purpose:** Stores public profile information for users, extending Appwrite's built-in Authentication users. This collection is for data that users might want to share publicly or that defines their application-specific profile.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `userID` (String, unique, primary key - this will be the same as Appwrite's Auth user ID, `$id` from the `users` auth object)
        *   *Description:* Unique identifier for the user, linking to the authentication entry.
    *   `displayName` (String, 100 chars max)
        *   *Description:* The user's public display name in the app.
    *   `profileImageCloudinaryUrl` (String, URL, optional)
        *   *Description:* URL to the user's profile picture, hosted on Cloudinary.
    *   `bio` (String, 500 chars max, optional)
        *   *Description:* A short biography or description provided by the user.
    *   `reputationPoints` (Integer, default: 0)
        *   *Description:* Points accumulated by the user for positive contributions (e.g., verified reports, helpful comments).
    *   `isActive` (Boolean, default: true)
        *   *Description:* Whether the user account is active.
    *   `notificationsEnabled` (Boolean, default: true)
        *   *Description:* User preference for receiving notifications.
    *   `preferredCategories` (Array of Strings, optional)
        *   *Description:* List of issue categories the user is most interested in.
*   **Indexes:**
    *   `userID` (Primary & Unique)
    *   `displayName` (for searching users)
    *   `reputationPoints` (for leaderboards or sorting)
*   **Permissions:**
    *   **Create:** `users` (An Appwrite function triggered on new auth user creation (`users.create` event) will create this document. The `userID` in this document should match the `$id` of the newly created auth user.)
    *   **Read:** `any` (Public profiles can be viewed by anyone)
    *   **Update:** `user:[userID]` (Users can only update their own profile), `team:admins`
    *   **Delete:** `team:admins` (Admins can delete user profiles, typically in conjunction with deleting the auth user)

        *   *Description:* Category of the reported issue. Consider using an Enum-like list for consistency. (For MVP, a string is fine; a `categories` collection could be a future enhancement).
    *   `location` (Object - GeoPoint, e.g., `{ "type": "Point", "coordinates": [longitude, latitude] }` or two separate Number fields if GeoPoint is not directly supported as a native Appwrite type for querying in all desired ways)

*   **Permissions:**
    *   **Create:** `users` (Any authenticated user can create a report)
    *   **Read:** `any` (All reports are publicly viewable)

---

## 6. Collection: `userSupports`

*   **Purpose:** Tracks which users support which reports or social causes (many-to-many relationship). This helps prevent a user from supporting the same item multiple times and allows for easy counting and listing of supporters.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `userID` (String, Relationship to `users` collection's `userID`)
        *   *Description:* The ID of the user who is supporting an item.
    *   `targetDocumentID` (String)
        *   *Description:* The ID of the document being supported (e.g., `reportID`, `socialCauseID`).
    *   `targetCollection` (String, e.g., 'reports', 'socialCauses')
        *   *Description:* The collection of the document being supported.
    *   `timestampCreated` (DateTime, Appwrite's `$createdAt`)
*   **Indexes:**
    *   Composite Index on (`userID`, `targetDocumentID`, `targetCollection`) (Unique - to ensure a user supports an item only once).
    *   `userID` (to list all items supported by a user).
    *   `targetDocumentID` (to list all users supporting an item - though count is often denormalized on parent).
*   **Permissions:**
    *   **Create:** `users` (Authenticated users can support an item). Logic within an Appwrite Function or client-side will prevent duplicate entries and increment/decrement the `supportCount` on the parent document (`reports` or `socialCauses`).
    *   **Read:** `users` (Users can see who supported what, if necessary, otherwise restrict to admins or just use for counting). Could be `user:[userID]` if users should only see their own support records.
    *   **Update:** `team:admins` (Generally no updates needed).
    *   **Delete:** `user:[userID]` (User can withdraw their support), `team:admins`. (Deletion should trigger decrementing `supportCount` on parent document via Appwrite Function).

This schema provides a comprehensive structure for the VozActiva Ciudadana application. Attribute types and constraints should be reviewed and adjusted based on Appwrite's specific capabilities and limitations during implementation. Permissions are also foundational and can be refined with more granular team-based roles as needed.
