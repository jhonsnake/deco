2.  **Phase 2: UI/UX Design and Frontend Development with Mock Data**
3.  **Phase 3: Frontend Development with Backend Integration**
4.  **Phase 4: Testing (QA)**
5.  **Phase 5: MVP Deployment**

## Assumptions

*   Clear requirements and scope for the MVP are defined before starting development.
*   Access to necessary stakeholders (e.g., city council contacts for future phases) will be available.
*   The development team possesses the necessary skills for the chosen technology stack.
*   Adequate budget and resources are allocated for each phase.

## Risks and Mitigation

*   **Scope Creep:** Regularly review project scope and manage change requests formally.
*   **Technical Debt:** Allocate time for code refactoring and maintain good coding standards.
*   **Vendor Lock-in (Cloud):** Design with portability in mind where feasible.
*   **App Store Rejection:** Thoroughly review app store guidelines before submission and allocate time for potential resubmissions.
*   **Low User Adoption:** Develop a marketing and outreach strategy alongside development.

This project plan provides a roadmap for the VozActiva Ciudadana application. Timelines are estimates and should be refined based on team size, complexity, and specific feature sets.
Regular communication and agile adjustments will be key to successful project execution.
